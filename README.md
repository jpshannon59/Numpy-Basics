# Numpy-Basics
Examples of how to use numpy.
Q1. Lets consider your data is like the below cell:
data = {"name": ["Joseph", "Jacob", "Sam", "Jesee", "Ryan", "Lisa", "Lee"],
        "job": ["teacher", "psychologist", "data scientist", "software developer", "psychologist", "psychologist", "teacher"],
        "family_size": [3, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 2],
        "num_cars": [3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 1]}

Q2. Lets consider you have two series like the below cell. Compute the mean of weights of each fruit.


Q3. Consider the below course_name array:

Q3-1: Write a NumPy program to get the indices of the sorted elements of course_name array.

Q3-2: Write numpy code to check whether each element of course_name array starts with "P".


Q4. Consider the below student_id array:

Q4-1: Reverse the student_id array. Print both original and reversed array.

Q4-2: Get the 3-largest values of student_id array.

Q5: Write a numpy program to print sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 100
